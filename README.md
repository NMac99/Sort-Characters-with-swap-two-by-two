# Sort-Characters-with-swap-two-by-two

The main concept of this application is swapping a sequence of 0's and 1's two by two for creating a sorted sequence.
I have been given a problem to solve on one of my interviews and I have developed an application for that.

Given a sequence of 0's and 1's.
Sort that sequence with swapping values two by two with showing each step.

Input:
1000101101010

Output:
0000000111111

Actualy this problem was a tough one, because I have created an algorithm and proved that it will work for every sequence starting from 5 characters.
Bellow that number there is no mathematical solution for some cases and it attaches a value to perform swapping.

I will upload pictures of application soon, but you really need to download and run it to see the work done.

In my time I have searched a lot for algorithms for this swapping but haven't find any, so I think this one can be useful for someone. It is a great algorithmical interview question as well!
